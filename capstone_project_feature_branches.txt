# Benefits of Using Feature Branches

- **Isolation**: Each task is developed in isolation, reducing the risk of conflicts and errors.
- **Parallel Development**: Different features can be developed concurrently by different team members.
- **Clear History**: Commit history remains clear and organized, making it easier to track changes and revert if necessary.

# Branch Management Tips

- Regularly merge updates from the `main` branch into your feature branches to keep them up to date.
- Use pull requests to merge feature branches back into `main` once the feature is complete and reviewed.
- Consider using descriptive names for your branches to make it clear what each branch is for.
